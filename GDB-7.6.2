Introduction to GDB

GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on “inside” another program while it 
executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. Note that GDB is most effective when 
tracing programs and libraries that were built with debugging symbols and not stripped.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-7.4 platform.

Short Descriptions

gdb
is the GNU Debugger.
gdbserver
is a remote server for the GNU debugger (it allows programs to be debugged from a different machine).
libinproctrace.so

listing static tracepoint markers, probing static tracepoints markers, and starting trace monitoring.
